Sets- 

Sets are one of 4 built in datatypes in python. The other 3 datatypes are list, tuple and dictionaries. 

A set is a collection of unordered, unchangeable and unindexed
 
PROPERTIES OF SET- 

1. unordered 
2. immutable 
3. unindexed 
4. Duplicates not allowed 
5. set can have different Datatypes

syntax of sets are- 
{"apple","bannana","cherry"}

since sets are not ordered, when you print a set you wont know which element would come first. In sets True and 1 are considered as same values. 

FUNCTIONS IN SET- 

1. len(set_1)
2. type(set_1)
3. x = set(arr)

len(set_1) gives you the length of the set 
type(set_1) will give you what type of datatypes are in the set
set(arr) is used to convert any datatype into set

ACCESS ELEMENTS IN SET- 
sets are unordered but we can iterate through each of its element by- 

for x in set_1:
print(x)

ADD ITEMS - 

like in lists we used .append here we use .add and .update 
.add - is used to add elements to set
.update is used to add 2 sets or any other data structure like list,tuples,etc

set_1.add("orange")
set_1.update(set_2)
set_1.update(list_1)

REMOVE ITEMS- 

1. set_1.remove("banana")
2. set_1.discard("banana")
3. set_1.pop()
4. set_1.clear() [empties the entire set]
5. del set_1

JOIN TWO SETS- 

1. x = set_1.union(set_2)
2. set_1.update(set_2)

INTERSECTIONS- 
 
1. to keep items that are BOTH in set x and y without declaring a new set

x.intersection_update(y)

2. to keep items that are BOTH in set x and y by declaring another new set- 

z = x.intersection(y)

KEEP ALL BUT NOT DUPLICATES- 

x= {1,2,3}
y= {4,5,1}

x.symmetric_difference_update(y)

it also doesnt require a new set declaration 
!-----ALSO ---!
union of sets- 
dayA= set(['Mon','Tue','Wed','Thur'])
dayB= set(['Wed','Thur','Fri','Sat','Sun'])
alldays= dayA | dayB
print(alldays) 

intersection of sets- 

days = dayA & dayB 

Difference of sets - 

days = dayA - dayB
